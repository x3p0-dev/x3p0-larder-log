/**
 * Taking a copy of something with you (D68).
 *
 * **Export is two features, and drawing it against the deletion rules is what
 * split it.** The pantry is the one thing account deletion has already
 * established *is not yours* — it belongs to the household and survives you —
 * so *Download your data* and *Export the pantry* are different exports, in
 * different places, answering different questions:
 *
 * | | Where | What it is |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | **Your data** | The account pane | Four fields, because there is nothing else. A legal obligation, not a feature |
 * | **The pantry** | Settings → Pantry settings | The household's rows. The one anybody wants |
 *
 * **Neither is a backup, because nothing imports one back.** Saying so is
 * cheap; the alternative is somebody deleting a household they thought they had
 * saved.
 *
 * **The two exports that describe rows offer CSV or JSON** — the pantry here,
 * and the audit log in `client/lib/activityExport.ts`. *Your data* does not:
 * it is four fields, two of which are lists of objects, and a CSV of that is a
 * file with two shapes in it.
 *
 * The *shape* of a file is domain logic and lives here. Handing one to a
 * browser is not — that reaches `Blob`, `URL` and `document`, three of the
 * identifiers the capsule compiler's denylist rejects outright — so the
 * download itself stays in `client/lib/download.ts` beside the app's first
 * one.
