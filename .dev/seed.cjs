/*
 * Seeds a local `sf dev` database with data worth clicking.
 *
 * It drives the **real handlers** over `POST /__spacefast/zero/run`, one call at
 * a time, exactly as `?demo` does and for the same reason: a row written any
 * other way is not the row the app produces. Nothing here is a fixture the
 * client would recognise as special — every household, item, invite and audit
 * entry is an ordinary one the moment it lands.
 *
 * **Dot-prefixed for D29's reason**: `sf publish` mirrors the project root and
 * does not honour `.gitignore`, but the serving layer refuses dot-prefixed
 * paths. This is a development tool and has no business being fetchable.
 *
 * **`.cjs`, not `.js`.** `package.json` says `"type": "module"`, so a `.js`
 * here is an ES module and `require` is not defined in one. The extension is
 * the whole fix, and it is also what lets this reach the CommonJS build of
 * `shared/` that `npm test` produces.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     node .dev/seed.cjs <capability-token> [port]
 *
 * The token is the `#zero-dev-capability=` fragment printed in `sf dev`'s
 * banner. The two identities come from `LARDER_DEV_GUESTS` in `.env.server`,
 * so seeding and signing in cannot disagree about who exists.
 *
 * **Do not edit any project file while this runs.** `sf dev` watches the tree
 * and reloads the runtime on a change; a reload mid-run drops whichever call is
 * in flight, which presents as a handler refusing a household it just created.
 *
 * It is **additive and not idempotent** — every run makes another set of
 * households. For a clean slate, stop `sf dev`, delete
 * `.spacefast/zero/dev-state.sqlite`, start it again, and run this once.
