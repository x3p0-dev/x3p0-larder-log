# Decisions

Choices we've made and the reasoning, so we don't relitigate them by accident.

## D1. Spacefast Zero as the platform

**Decided:** 2026-08-24

The app needs a database, sign-in for two people, and live updates across
devices. Zero supplies all three with no infrastructure to operate, and
publishing is one command.

**Trade-off accepted:** we inherit Zero's constraints wholesale — no numeric
column type, no arrays, no row-level security, Preact rather than React. Those
are real and shape the data model.

---

## D2. Require sign-in; no guest mode

**Decided:** 2026-08-24

Zero gives every visitor a guest identity that could own rows, which would allow
a try-before-you-sign-in experience. We're not doing that.

**Why:** it introduces an adoption problem — when a guest signs in, do their
guest-owned rows migrate to the new identity, get discarded, or merge? Every
answer is work, and none of it serves the primary use case of two people who
will sign in once and stay signed in.

**Consequence:** the sign-in gate is the entire unauthenticated surface.
Revisit only if we ever want strangers to evaluate the app.

## D3. Multi-household schema, single-household UI

**Decided:** 2026-08-24

Every row carries `householdId` from the first migration, but v1 ships no
household switcher. The UI assumes "your household".

**Why:** retrofitting a scoping column onto existing rows requires a destructive
migration, which Zero deliberately makes awkward. Adding a switcher later is
purely additive. Pay the cheap cost now to avoid the expensive one later.

---

## D4. Numbers are strings

**Decided:** 2026-08-24 · **Forced by the platform**

Zero's schema types are `string()`, `boolean()`, and `id(table)`. There is no
numeric type. `qty` and `threshold` are stored as decimal strings.

**Rules that follow:** parse on read through a single helper, validate and clamp
on the server, and never sort by these fields in the database (string ordering
puts "10" before "2" — quantity sorting is client-side).

**Rejected:** zero-padded strings. They'd make database sorting correct but leak
an encoding detail into every read and every write.

---

## D5. Join tables for many-to-many

**Decided:** 2026-08-24 · **Forced by the platform**

No array or JSON field type exists, so the prototype's `item.types[]` and
`item.stores[]` become `itemTypes` and `itemStores` join tables.

**Consequence:** reading an item's full shape means joining, and writing one
means reconciling join rows. `householdId` is denormalized onto the join tables
so household-scoped reads and cleanup don't have to walk through `items`.

---

## D6. Invite links with a join code

**Decided:** 2026-08-24

Membership is granted by opening `/join/<code>` while signed in.

**Why not email invites:** sign-in is Gravatar-based, so the address someone
signs in with may not be the one you'd type into an invite form. A link works
regardless of which identity they land on.

**Consequence:** the code is a bearer credential. It must be revocable, and we
should think about whether it expires.

---

## D7. Keep the prototype's theme system; don't adopt the kit wholesale

**Decided:** 2026-08-24

`@spacefast/zero/kit` provides `Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Badge`, and Lucide
icons. We use it where it's generic, but keep the hand-rolled "ink → tint/ring"
color derivation from the prototype.

**Why:** that color system is the app's visual identity — every location, type,
store, and status derives its palette from a single hex. A generic component kit
can't express it.

---

## D8. Port the Vite prototype, then retire it

**Decided:** 2026-08-24

The React/Vite app in `src/` moves into `client/` and is deleted, rather than
being kept as a parallel design sandbox.

**Why:** two codebases drift, and the prototype's value was settling the
interaction design, which it has done. The mockup `.jsx` stays as the design
reference.

---

## D9. Status is derived, never stored

**Decided:** 2026-08-24

`out` / `low` / `ok` is computed from `qty` and `threshold` at render time.

**Why:** a stored status is a second source of truth that drifts the moment
someone edits a threshold. The computation is trivial.
